# 🔥 1. ML System Pipeline Diagram (For Traditional ML Systems)
This pipeline represents a full ML system, including data ingestion, training, deployment, inference, and monitoring.

---
## 📌 Steps to Create the ML Pipeline Diagram:
---
### Data Layer

📥 Raw Data Ingestion → Collecting structured/unstructured data (APIs, logs, CSVs).
🔄 Data Cleaning & Transformation → Handle missing values, normalize data.
🏦 Feature Store / Data Lake → Store cleaned features for training & inference.
Model Development Layer

🛠 Feature Engineering → Transform raw data into useful ML features.
🏋️‍♂️ Model Training → Train models using supervised/unsupervised learning.
🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning → Optimize learning rate, batch size, regularization.
📊 Model Evaluation → Metrics: Accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1-score.

### Deployment & Inference Layer

🚀 MLflow / TensorFlow Serving → Deploy models as APIs.
⚡ Real-time / Batch Inference → Run predictions at scale.
🔀 Cache & Load Balancer → Optimize response time.

### Monitoring & Feedback Layer

🔍 Model Drift Detection → Detect distribution shifts in data.
📊 Logging & Observability → Track performance using Grafana, Prometheus.
🔄 User Feedback Loop → Fine-tune models with real-world data.
---
### Try:
Use draw.io / Excalidraw and create 4 main sections (Data → Training → Deployment → Monitoring) with arrows connecting each stage.
