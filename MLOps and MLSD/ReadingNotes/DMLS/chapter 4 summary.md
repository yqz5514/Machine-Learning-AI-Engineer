# üìå Chapter 4 Summary: Training Data

## **üìå The Importance of Training Data**
- **Training data is the foundation of modern ML algorithms**‚Äîno matter how advanced an algorithm is, **poor-quality data leads to poor performance**.
- It‚Äôs essential to **invest time in curating high-quality datasets** to ensure meaningful learning.

## **üìå Key Topics Covered**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sampling Methods**
- **Goal**: Select the right data for training to improve model generalization.
- **Types of Sampling**:
  - **Nonprobability Sampling**: Convenience sampling, judgment sampling.
  - **Random Sampling**: Simple random sampling, stratified sampling, reservoir sampling.
- **Why It Matters**: Ensures the dataset represents the problem space **without biasing the model**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Labeling Strategies**
- Most ML models today are **supervised**, meaning **labeling data is crucial**.
- **Natural Labels**:
  - Found in real-world feedback mechanisms (e.g., delivery time estimation, recommender systems).
  - **Challenge**: Labels are **delayed** ‚Üí The time gap between prediction and feedback is called the **feedback loop length**.
- **Manual Labeling**:
  - Used when natural labels don‚Äôt exist.
  - **Challenges**: Expensive, slow, and prone to inconsistencies.
- **Alternatives to Manual Labeling**:
  - **Weak Supervision**: Uses heuristics to generate labels.
  - **Semi-Supervision**: Uses a small labeled dataset to guide the labeling of a larger dataset.
  - **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained models to reduce labeled data needs.
  - **Active Learning**: The model **selects** the most important samples for human labeling.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Class Imbalance Challenges & Solutions**
- **Class Imbalance**:
  - When one class has **significantly fewer samples** than others.
  - **Common in real-world applications** like fraud detection, medical diagnoses.
- **How It Affects ML Models**:
  - Bias toward majority class.
  - Poor generalization for minority class.
- **Solutions**:
  - **Choosing the right evaluation metrics** (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-score instead of accuracy).
  - **Resampling** (Oversampling, Undersampling, SMOTE).
  - **Modifying Loss Functions** (Cost-sensitive learning, Focal loss).

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Augmentation**
- **Improves model performance and generalization** by artificially increasing the size of the training dataset.
- **Techniques**:
  - **For Computer Vision**: Rotation, flipping, cropping, noise injection.
  - **For NLP**: Synonym replacement, back-translation, text perturbation.
  - **For All Modalities**: Generative models (GANs, MixUp) to synthesize new data.

## **üìå Next Steps: Feature Engineering**
- After preparing high-quality training data, the next step is **feature extraction**.
- **Why It‚Äôs Important**:
  - Helps models learn relevant patterns efficiently.
  - **Feature selection and transformation** can significantly impact model performance.

## **üìå Final Takeaways (3-Sentence Summary)**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Good training data is essential for effective ML models‚Äîtechniques like sampling, labeling, and augmentation improve data quality.**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Class imbalance must be addressed using appropriate metrics, resampling strategies, or adjusted loss functions to prevent biased predictions.**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **With properly prepared training data, the next step is feature engineering, which plays a crucial role in model performance.**
