# Ch1.2
## 📌 Key Takeaways (3-Sentence Summary)
1️⃣ ML research focuses on SOTA performance, while production prioritizes speed, interpretability, and real-world constraints.
2️⃣ Latency is a critical metric in ML systems, with percentiles (p50,p95, p99) offering a more reliable measurement than mean latency.
3️⃣ Batch processing can increase inference latency, but is commonly used in large-scale distributed ML systems for efficiency.

## 📌 If an Interviewer Asks...
### ❓ Q1: Why is ML latency measurement important in production?
✅ Answer:
Latency affects user experience and system performance. Mean latency can be misleading, so high percentiles (e.g., p95) help detect outliers and ensure real-world system reliability.

### ❓ Q2: Why does ML in production prioritize interpretability?
✅ Answer:
Interpretability is essential for debugging, bias detection, and regulatory compliance. In high-stakes applications like loan approval and medical diagnosis, a black-box model is often unacceptable.

### ❓ Q3: How does batch processing affect ML inference?
✅ Answer:
Batching improves computational efficiency, but introduces higher latency, since the system must wait for enough queries before processing them.

✅ Answer:
LLMs are text-only, whereas Foundational Models support multimodal inputs (text, images, audio, video), allowing AI to work across diverse domains like healthcare, robotics, and finance.

### ❓ Q3: How can an AI engineer improve a model’s performance?
✅ Answer:

Prompt Engineering (optimize inputs for better model outputs).
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) (integrate external knowledge for more accurate responses).
Fine-Tuning (train models on domain-specific data for better specialization).

✅ Answer:
Foundation Models are widely used in coding, writing, customer service, and workflow automation, enabling organizations to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and optimize business processes.

### ❓ Q2: How is AI impacting software engineering jobs?
✅ Answer:
AI accelerates coding productivity but is less effective in highly complex tasks. It is expected to automate simple programming tasks while augmenting engineers rather than fully replacing them.

### ❓ Q3: What are the ethical concerns surrounding generative AI?
✅ Answer:
AI raises concerns about content authenticity, misinformation, bias, and automation-related job losses, requiring responsible AI governance and oversight.

# 两天总结问题：
## 📌 Common Interview Questions & How My Learning Helps Me Answer

### ❓ Q1: What are the key differences between ML research and production?
✅ Answer:

Research focuses on SOTA accuracy, while production prioritizes latency, interpretability, and cost.
Production models face real-world constraints (e.g., data drift, stakeholder requirements, infrastructure scaling).
Example: A restaurant recommendation system must balance business objectives (revenue) with latency requirements (sub-100ms response time).
### ❓ Q2: How would you optimize inference latency in a production ML system?
✅ Answer:

Batch processing: Process multiple queries at once to improve efficiency.
Quantization & Model Compression: Reduce model size without significant accuracy loss.
Using high-percentile latency metrics (p95, p99) instead of mean latency to measure performance.
🚀 Example: In LLM API deployment, batching can increase throughput but also delay response time, requiring trade-offs.

### ❓ Q3: What is the difference between LLM and Foundational Models?
✅ Answer:

LLM (Large Language Models) focus on text-based AI (e.g., ChatGPT).
Foundational Models extend beyond text to multimodal AI (e.g., OpenAI DALL-E for image generation, Gemini for cross-modal tasks).
🚀 Example: Companies prefer Foundational Models for enterprise AI due to broader adaptability across domains.

### ❓ Q4: How would you improve AI-generated content reliability?
✅ Answer:

Prompt Engineering: Design structured inputs to guide AI responses.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Connect LLMs with external knowledge bases.
Fine-Tuning: Train models on domain-specific datasets for better accuracy.

## 📌 Key Takeaways (3-Sentence Summary)
1️⃣ **ML system design requires aligning business goals with ML metrics, ensuring reliability, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability.**  
2️⃣ **The ML lifecycle is iterative, requiring continuous monitoring, retraining, and business impact analysis.**  
3️⃣ **Balancing multiple objectives in ML (e.g., quality vs. engagement) is best achieved through separate models rather than optimizing a single loss function.**  

---
## 📌 If an Interviewer Asks... (Based on Chapter 2 of Designing Machine Learning Systems)
### ❓ Q1: How do you ensure that an ML system aligns with business objectives?
✅ Answer:

ML systems should directly impact key business metrics such as revenue, engagement, or operational efficiency.
Define ML-specific objectives (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) and map them to business KPIs (e.g., click-through rate, cost savings).
Example: In an e-commerce recommendation system, optimizing CTR directly increases sales volume, making CTR a business-aligned ML metric.
### ❓ Q2: What are the key challenges when transitioning an ML model from research to production?
✅ Answer:

Scalability: Handling increased traffic, adapting models for real-time inference.
Reliability: Ensuring consistent performance despite data drift & system failures.
Maintainability: Implementing version control, monitoring, and automated retraining to keep models updated.
Multiple Stakeholders: Balancing different requirements from ML engineers, product teams, infrastructure teams, and business leaders.
🚀 Example:

Research models prioritize SOTA accuracy, but in production, a lower-latency model may be preferred to improve user experience.
### ❓ Q3: How would you design an ML system that balances multiple conflicting objectives?
✅ Answer:

Decouple objectives into separate models, then combine their outputs using a weighted ranking system.
Example: AI-powered news feed ranking:
Model A → Prioritizes high-quality content (low spam, verified sources).
Model B → Optimizes for user engagement (high click-through rate).
Final Score = α * quality_score + β * engagement_score, where α and β are tunable parameters.
This approach allows flexibility in optimizing different trade-offs without retraining models.
