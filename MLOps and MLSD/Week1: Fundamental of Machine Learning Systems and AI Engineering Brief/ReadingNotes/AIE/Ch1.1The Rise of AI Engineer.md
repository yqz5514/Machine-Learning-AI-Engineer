# AI Engineering - Chapter 1.1 Summary

## 📌 The Rise of AI Engineer
### Why AI Engineers are Becoming Essential?
- Large Language Models (LLMs) evolved from traditional Language Models (LMs) by leveraging **self-supervised learning** to train on massive datasets, improving predictive accuracy.
- LLMs require **high computational power** and **large-scale training data**, making **AI engineering critical** for optimizing performance and deployment.
- The demand for **AI engineers** is rising due to the complexity of **deploying, fine-tuning, and integrating AI models** into real-world applications.

## 📌 From LM to LLM: Understanding Language Models
### What is a Language Model?
- A **language model** learns statistical patterns in text to predict **the next token** based on given input.
- **Tokens** are the fundamental units processed by LLMs:
  - **A token can be a word or part of a word** (GPT-4 token ≈ ¾ of an English word).
  - **Why tokens?**
    1. Capture more **meaningful sub-word information**.
    2. Reduce **vocabulary size**, improving efficiency.
    3. Handle **unknown words (OOV)** better.

### Types of Language Models
| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Example Models** | **Use Cases** |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Masked LM** | Predicts missing words in a sentence | **BERT** | Text classification, sentiment analysis, code correction |
| **Auto-regressive LM** | Predicts the next token sequentially | **GPT-3, GPT-4** | Text generation, AI chatbots |

**🔹 Key Difference:**  
- Traditional **LMs** act as **completion models**, predicting text **but not engaging in conversation**.
- **LLMs** (GPT-4, Claude) can **generate long-form responses**, **engage in dialogue**, and **answer complex queries**.

## 📌 Foundational Models: Beyond Text Processing
### Why Move from LLM to Foundational Models?
- Traditional LLMs are **limited to text-based tasks**.
- **Foundational Models** (a.k.a. **General-Purpose AI Models**) expand AI capabilities to handle **multiple data modalities** (text, image, audio, video).

### Key Types of Foundational Models
| **Model Type** | **Capability** | **Example Models** |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **LLM (Large Language Model)** | Text-only processing | GPT-4, Claude 3 |
| **Multimodal Model** | Handles **text + image** together | Gemini 1.5, GPT-4V, Flamingo |
| **LMM (Generative Multimodal Model)** | Generates **text + images + video** | Stable Diffusion, DALL-E |
| **Embedding Model** | Converts data into vector representations for retrieval tasks | OpenAI Embeddings, CLIP |

## 📌 How to Improve AI Model Performance?
AI models don’t always generate the desired outputs. **Three key techniques** help optimize them:

### 🔹 1. Prompt Engineering
- The process of **designing input prompts** to guide AI models to generate better responses.
- **Use Case**: Improving LLM response quality in chatbots, creative writing, and code generation.

### 🔹 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Combines external knowledge sources** with AI models to improve response accuracy.
- **Use Case**: AI-assisted **document search, customer support bots, and legal AI tools**.

### 🔹 3. Fine-Tuning
- **Customizing pre-trained models** on specific datasets to improve performance in niche applications.
- **Use Case**: Specialized AI for **medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, and financial risk modeling**.
