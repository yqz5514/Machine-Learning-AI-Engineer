# AI Engineering - Chapter 1.4 Summary

## üìå The AI Engineering Stack
AI engineering has evolved **from ML engineering**, leading to a rapidly expanding ecosystem of tools, frameworks, and best practices.  

To build AI applications effectively, we must **understand the AI stack**, which consists of three core layers:  
1. **Application Development**  
2. **Model Development**  
3. **Infrastructure**  

---

## üìå 1. Three Layers of the AI Stack  
| **Layer** | **Description** | **Key Considerations** |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Application Development** | Using foundation models to build AI products. | AI interface, context construction(Prompt engineering), user interfaces, evaluation. |
| **Model Development** | Tools for model training, fine-tuning, and optimizing AI models. | Dataset engineering, inference optimization, pre-training vs. post-training. |
| **Infrastructure** | Managing data and compute, model serving, and monitoring. | Scalability, cost-efficiency, real-time processing. |

üìå **Key Takeaway**: **AI engineers often start at the application layer and move down as needed, whereas ML engineers traditionally focus more on model development.**  

---

## üìå 2. How AI Engineering Differs from ML Engineering  
Although AI and ML engineering share foundational principles, **building AI applications using foundation models differs from traditional ML workflows** in three major ways:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Adaptation vs. Training**  
- **ML Engineering** ‚Üí Requires training models from scratch.  
- **AI Engineering** ‚Üí Uses **pre-trained models**, less on modeling and training, more on model adaption.(e.g. **prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  )

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Computational & Infrastructure Demands**  
- **Foundation models** are significantly larger, requiring **more compute resources** and **low-latency inference optimization**.  
- **AI engineers must be proficient in GPU acceleration, parallelism, and distributed training.**  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluating Open-Ended Outputs**  
- Traditional ML tasks (e.g., fraud detection) is colse-ended, have **clear ground truths**.  
- AI-generated outputs (e.g., chatbot responses) is open-ended, better for varity tasks but **lack absolute correctness**, making evaluation challenging.  

üìå **Key Takeaway**: **AI engineering prioritizes model adaptation, inference efficiency, and qualitative evaluation, whereas ML engineering focuses on traditional model developmetn, training and evaluation.**  

---

## üìå 2. Model Development: Training, Fine-Tuning & Optimization  
Traditional ML workflows focus on **training models from scratch**, whereas AI engineering primarily involves **adapting pre-trained models**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Training Phases in AI Engineering**
| **Phase** | **Description** | **Compute Requirement** |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-training** | Training a model from scratch on massive datasets. | **Extremely high (98% of training cost)** |
| **Fine-tuning** | Adjusting a pre-trained model on specific data. | **Moderate** |
| **Post-training** | Further optimizing a model after pre-training (e.g., instruction tuning). | **Varies** |

üìå **Example**:  
- **OpenAI‚Äôs InstructGPT** ‚Üí Pre-training took **98% of compute**, fine-tuning handled **user-specific tasks**.  
- **ChatGPT customization** ‚Üí Users fine-tune via **context & prompt engineering** instead of direct training.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Engineering**
Traditional ML models rely on **structured tabular data**, whereas AI models work with **unstructured text, images, and videos**.

| **ML Engineering** | **AI Engineering** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Focuses on **feature engineering** for tabular data. | Focuses on **context retrieval, deduplication, tokenization**. |
| Requires labeled datasets for supervised learning. | Often uses **self-supervised or reinforcement learning**. |

üìå **Key Takeaway**: **AI engineers spend more time on prompt design and retrieval than traditional feature engineering.**  

---

## üìå 3. Inference Optimization & Scalability  
Deploying foundation models requires **careful optimization to balance speed, cost, and scalability**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges in AI Model Deployment**
| **Challenge** | **Why It‚Äôs a Problem?** | **Solution** |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Compute Costs** | Foundation models are large, making inference expensive. | Quantization, serverless inference. |
| **Latency Constraints** | Real-time applications need low-latency responses. | Model parallelism, distillation. |
| **Scaling Requests** | Handling thousands to millions of concurrent queries. | Load balancing, autoscaling on cloud. |

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Optimization Techniques**
| **Method** | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Quantization** | Reducing model precision to lower memory usage. | FP16 ‚Üí INT8 |
| **Model Distillation** | Training a smaller model to mimic a larger model‚Äôs performance. | GPT-3 ‚Üí GPT-3.5 |
| **Parallel Processing** | Distributing computation across multiple GPUs or clusters. | Tensor Parallelism |

üìå **Key Takeaway**: **AI engineers must optimize inference pipelines to improve efficiency while minimizing costs.**

## üìå 4. AI Application Development & Evaluation 

**The application developmeny layer consists of these responsibilitiesL evaluation, prompt engineering, and AI interface.**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges in Evaluating AI Models**
Foundation models introduce **new evaluation challenges** compared to traditional ML models.

| **Challenge** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **No Absolute Ground Truth** | Open-ended applications lack a single correct answer. |
| **Contextual Dependence** | Model responses vary significantly based on input phrasing. |
| **Bias & Fairness Issues** | Foundation models may inherit biases from training data. |

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation Metrics**
| **Metric** | **Use Case** | **Example** |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Perplexity** | Measures model uncertainty in language models. | Lower perplexity = Better fluency. |
| **BLEU / ROUGE** | Evaluates text generation quality. | Summarization & translation models. |
| **Human Preference Score** | Assesses real-world response quality. | RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). |

üìå **Key Takeaway**: **AI model evaluation requires both automated metrics and human judgment.**
