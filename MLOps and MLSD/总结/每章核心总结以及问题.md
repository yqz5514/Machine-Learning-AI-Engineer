### 📌 Key Takeaways (3-Sentence Summary)
- 1️⃣ ML research focuses on SOTA performance, while production prioritizes speed, interpretability, and real-world constraints.
- 2️⃣ Latency is a critical metric in ML systems, with percentiles (p50,p95, p99) offering a more reliable measurement than mean latency.
- 3️⃣ Batch processing can increase inference latency, but is commonly used in large-scale distributed ML systems for efficiency.

### 📌 If an Interviewer Asks...
#### ❓ Q1: Why is ML latency measurement important in production?
✅ Answer:
Latency affects user experience and system performance. Mean latency can be misleading, so high percentiles (e.g., p95) help detect outliers and ensure real-world system reliability.

#### ❓ Q2: Why does ML in production prioritize interpretability?
✅ Answer:
Interpretability is essential for debugging, bias detection, and regulatory compliance. In high-stakes applications like loan approval and medical diagnosis, a black-box model is often unacceptable.

#### ❓ Q3: How does batch processing affect ML inference?
✅ Answer:
Batching improves computational efficiency, but introduces higher latency, since the system must wait for enough queries before processing them.

### 📌 Key Takeaways (3-Sentence Summary)
1️⃣ **ML system design requires aligning business goals with ML metrics, ensuring reliability, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability.**  
2️⃣ **The ML lifecycle is iterative, requiring continuous monitoring, retraining, and business impact analysis.**  
3️⃣ **Balancing multiple objectives in ML (e.g., quality vs. engagement) is best achieved through separate models rather than optimizing a single loss function.**  

---
### 📌 If an Interviewer Asks... (Based on Chapter 2 of Designing Machine Learning Systems)
#### ❓ Q1: How do you ensure that an ML system aligns with business objectives?
✅ Answer:

ML systems should directly impact key business metrics such as revenue, engagement, or operational efficiency.
Define ML-specific objectives (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) and map them to business KPIs (e.g., click-through rate, cost savings).
Example: In an e-commerce recommendation system, optimizing CTR directly increases sales volume, making CTR a business-aligned ML metric.
#### ❓ Q2: What are the key challenges when transitioning an ML model from research to production?
✅ Answer:

Scalability: Handling increased traffic, adapting models for real-time inference.
Reliability: Ensuring consistent performance despite data drift & system failures.
Maintainability: Implementing version control, monitoring, and automated retraining to keep models updated.
Multiple Stakeholders: Balancing different requirements from ML engineers, product teams, infrastructure teams, and business leaders.
🚀 Example:

Research models prioritize SOTA accuracy, but in production, a lower-latency model may be preferred to improve user experience.
#### ❓ Q3: How would you design an ML system that balances multiple conflicting objectives?
✅ Answer:

Decouple objectives into separate models, then combine their outputs using a weighted ranking system.
Example: AI-powered news feed ranking:
Model A → Prioritizes high-quality content (low spam, verified sources).
Model B → Optimizes for user engagement (high click-through rate).
Final Score = α * quality_score + β * engagement_score, where α and β are tunable parameters.
This approach allows flexibility in optimizing different trade-offs without retraining models.
