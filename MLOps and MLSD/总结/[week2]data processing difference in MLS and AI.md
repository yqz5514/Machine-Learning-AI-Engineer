## 📌 Key Interview Questions & Answers
### ❓ Q1: What is the difference between ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)?
✅ Answer:

ETL: Data is processed before storage, ensuring structured, cleaned data in databases.
ELT: Raw data is stored first, then transformed dynamically, allowing for more flexible and scalable processing.
Example: ETL is used in traditional data warehouses, while ELT is common in big data pipelines and AI applications.
### ❓ Q2: How does synthetic data benefit AI Engineering, and what are its risks?
✅ Answer:

Benefits:
Expands dataset size when real data is scarce.
Protects privacy by replacing real data with AI-generated alternatives.
Enhances data coverage for diverse AI model training.
Risks:
Low-quality synthetic data can introduce bias and hallucinations.
Model collapse occurs when AI models are trained recursively on AI-generated data.
Legal & ethical risks (e.g., training on copyrighted material without consent).
📌 Example: Llama 3 used AI-generated coding datasets to improve model performance, demonstrating how synthetic data can enhance AI learning.

### ❓ Q3: What is the difference between Model-Centric AI and Data-Centric AI?
✅ Answer:

Model-Centric AI focuses on enhancing models via new architectures, larger models, and advanced training techniques.
Data-Centric AI optimizes data quality and processing, improving AI performance with fewer resources.
Key Insight: AI performance gains require both model and data improvements.
📌 Example: Meta’s Llama 3 team improved performance not by changing model architecture but by optimizing high-quality data curation.

## 📌 Key Takeaways (3-Sentence Summary)
1️⃣ Data Engineering for ML Systems focuses on batch processing, structured storage, and feature engineering, while AI Engineering emphasizes real-time streaming, unstructured data, and AI-augmented curation.
