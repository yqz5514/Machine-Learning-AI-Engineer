## 📌 2. How to Apply This Knowledge to Resume & Interviews

### **✅ Optimizing My Resume**
📌 **Key Resume Enhancements**:
- **Project Experience**:
  - "Optimized model inference latency from **200ms → 50ms** using **batch processing & quantization**."
  - "Integrated **LLM API (LangChain + OpenAI)** for AI-powered knowledge retrieval, improving query accuracy by **30%**."
- **Technical Skills Section**:
  - **MLOps (Latency Optimization, Batch Processing, Model Monitoring)**
  - **LLM API Development (LangChain, RAG, Fine-Tuning)**
  - **AI System Design & Deployment (Kubernetes, MLflow, TensorRT)**

---

### **✅ Enhancing My Interview Performance**
📌 **Common Interview Questions & How My Learning Helps Me Answer**

#### **❓ Q1: What are the key differences between ML research and production?**
✅ **Answer**:
- Research focuses on **SOTA accuracy**, while production prioritizes **latency, interpretability, and cost**.
- **Production models face real-world constraints** (e.g., data drift, stakeholder requirements, infrastructure scaling).
- **Example**: A **restaurant recommendation system** must balance **business objectives (revenue)** with **latency requirements (sub-100ms response time).**

---

#### **❓ Q2: How would you optimize inference latency in a production ML system?**
✅ **Answer**:
- **Batch processing**: Process multiple queries at once to improve efficiency.
- **Quantization & Model Compression**: Reduce model size without significant accuracy loss.
- **Using high-percentile latency metrics (p95, p99)** instead of mean latency to measure performance.

🚀 **Example**: In **LLM API deployment**, batching can **increase throughput but also delay response time**, requiring trade-offs.

---

#### **❓ Q3: What is the difference between LLM and Foundational Models?**
✅ **Answer**:
- **LLM** (Large Language Models) focus on **text-based AI** (e.g., ChatGPT).
- **Foundational Models** extend beyond text to **multimodal AI** (e.g., OpenAI DALL-E for image generation, Gemini for cross-modal tasks).

🚀 **Example**: **Companies prefer Foundational Models** for enterprise AI due to **broader adaptability across domains.**

---

#### **❓ Q4: How would you improve AI-generated content reliability?**
✅ **Answer**:
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Design structured inputs to guide AI responses.
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Connect LLMs with external knowledge bases.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Train models on domain-specific datasets for better accuracy.

🚀 **Example**: AI-powered **legal assistants use RAG** to reference laws before generating responses.
