This repo contains daily study plan for Algorithma and data structure.
Code in Python.


"Once you've learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for example, **linked lists**:

1. Open one of the [coding interview books](https://github.com/yqz5514/coding-interview-university?tab=readme-ov-file#interview-prep-books) (or coding problem websites, listed below)
2. Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists.
3. Move on to the next learning topic.
4. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems.
5. Do this with each new topic you learn.

**Keep doing problems while you're learning all this stuff, not after.**

You're not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge.

**The Daily Plan**

This course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few days, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule.

Each day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that subject, and then write an implementation of that data structure or algorithm in the language you chose for this course."
